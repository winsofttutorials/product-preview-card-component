## My process

Fisrtly, I had an analysis of the both designs to understand the task.
I understood we had 3 components which is one bigger frame and two smaller frames of equal sizes.

I used grid layering to set my components.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

With this design I was able to work on my responsive design and it was really sweet working that out.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I would like to and a next button and also a payout form page.
